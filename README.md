# Weather Lion

Author: Wesley Ng

Is it hot? Is it cold? Is is somehow raining at LMU? Fret not! This program is aimed to find the weather at Loyola Marymount University.

## How It Works

This webapp gives users at LMU the outside temperature at Marina Del Ray, Los Angeles, CA, projecting forecast for the current day as well as the next 3 days.

At the top right of the main body of the web app, the big number will display the current temperature at Marina Del Ray in Fahrenheit (F). This number will always change as time progresses.

At the bottom of the body, there will be 3 numbers, displaying all forecasted temperatures from left to right in Fahrenheit (F).

Each temperature value for the current day or the next six days should always update. If you open this app on the current day and open this again on a different day, then the values must change for all of the days.

You can also choose to input a location based on its latitude and longitude and it will output that area's current and future temperature.
